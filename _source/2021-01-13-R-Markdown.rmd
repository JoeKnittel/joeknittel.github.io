```{r setup, include=FALSE}
base_dir <- "~/GitHub/joeknittel.github.io" # i.e. where the jekyll blog is on the hard drive.
base_url <- "/" # keep as is
fig_path <- "images/" # customize to heart's content, I 'spose.

knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = base_dir, base.url = base_url)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig_path,
                      cache.path = '../cache/',

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
