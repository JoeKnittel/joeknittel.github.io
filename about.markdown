Hi, I'm <a href = "https://joeknittel.com/">Joe</a>, a thirtysomething who, after meandering hither and thither in my early post-college years, finds himself as an up-and-coming actuarial science practitioner.

This blog will serve primarily as a tool to document what I've learned throughout my studies and exhibit various projects I've completed. I hope that, in doing so, it may prove to be useful to others who are in the midst of a similar journey.

Just as the field is evolving quickly to keep up with changes in the technological landscape, I endeavor that this site remain relevant well into the future by incorporating state-of-the-art techniques from various fields.

Read everything and thirsting for more? <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gs07ubcfuQOrbJ5QCoZjuy359xcsnL3w4ekPk7J6S_8/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a>'s a taste of what's in store for the blog.
