Hi, I'm <a href = "https://joeknittel.com/">Joe</a>, a thirtysomething who, after meandering hither and thither in my early post-college years, finds himself as an up-and-coming actuarial science practitioner.

This blog will serve primarily as a tool to document what I've learned throughout my studies and exhibit various projects I've completed; I hope that, in doing so, it may prove useful to others on a similar journey.

In an attempt to remain relevant in the ever-evolving technological landscape, much of the blog's content will focus on incorporating state-of-the-art tools and techniques, borrowing heavily from advances in computer science and data science.

Read everything and thirsting for more? Here's a taste of <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gs07ubcfuQOrbJ5QCoZjuy359xcsnL3w4ekPk7J6S_8/edit?usp=sharing"> what's in store</a>.
