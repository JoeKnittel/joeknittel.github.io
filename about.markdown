Hi, I'm Joe, a 30-something who, after meandering hither and thither for a while after graduating college, finds himself as an up-and-coming actuarial student.

This blog will serve primarily as a tool to document what I've learned throughout my studies and exhibit various projects I've completed for work and for fun.

Just as the field is evolving quickly to keep up with changes in the technological landscape, I, too, hope to keep this site relevant with fresh ideas spanning various fields.
