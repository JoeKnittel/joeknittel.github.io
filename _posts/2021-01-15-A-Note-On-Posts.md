It appears as though everything is configured properly, so I'd like to take a moment to describe the type of content I'll be posting on this blog.

### What to Expect

Blog posts will be comprised of:

1. `Summaries of major projects` I've completed, referencing code hosted on my GitHub

2. Discussions on `useful tools` I've recently come across (not-so-well-known program features, software libraries, etc.)

3. `Book reviews` covering a broad range of scientific topics  

4. Thoughts regarding `news pertaining to the actuarial field`

I'm sure there'll be some philosophical digressions interspersed between the core posts described above, but I'll do my best to control myself. No promises.

### Up Next

Tune in next time for something more substantive.
