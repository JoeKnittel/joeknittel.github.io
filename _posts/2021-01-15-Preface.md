It appears as though everything is configured properly, so I'd like to take a moment to describe the type of content I'll be posting on this blog.

## What to Expect

The vast majority of blog posts will take one of the following forms:

1. *Summaries of major projects* I've completed, referencing code hosted on my GitHub

2. Demonstrations of *useful tools* I've recently come across (not-so-well-known program features, software libraries, etc.)

3. *Book reviews* covering a broad range of scientific topics  

4. Thoughts regarding *news pertaining to the actuarial field*

I'm sure there'll be some philosophical digressions interspersed between the core posts described above, but I'll do my best to control myself. No promises.

## Coming Up

Data and a set of tools used to manipulate and analyze data are at the heart of any modern science. This fact is no more true than in the field of actuarial science, and it's becoming more and more the case each day.

With that said, most of the first few core posts on this blog will center around working with data. Then, once we've built up a technological foundation, we'll get into the meat and bones of this endeavor: projects exploring the various sub-fields of actuarial science.
