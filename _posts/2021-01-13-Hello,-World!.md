This is just a test post to make sure everything's set up properly.

**A bit of Python code**:

{% highlight python %}

x = 10
while(x):
    print("TRUE")
    x-=1

{% endhighlight %}

$\Gamma(\alpha) = \int_0^\infty t^{\alpha-1}e^{-t} \ dt, \quad \alpha > 0$

**To-do List**:

- Get images to display (Jekyll issue)
- Configure .yml for direct .rmd -> blog post conversion
- Improve lexer for code hightlighting
- Probably a bunch of other things that I'll notice later
